## Customer
- A sign-up and a login
- all the details are stored in MySQL DB

## Rental
- A 'book' form and a 'relieve' form
- When a car is rented from a login, it can be relieved from the same login

## Admin
- A login, like everyone
- Can add and remove cars from DB

## Design
### Back-End
- Main implements all, based on the inputs entered by the user
### Front-End
- Will do it soon
